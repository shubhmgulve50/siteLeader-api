# .claude/RULES.md — Standing Instructions

Read this file at the start of every session.
These rules apply to every task in this repository without exception.
No need to re-state them in a prompt — they are always active.

---

## 1. Documentation sync (mandatory)

- All documentation lives in the `readme/` directory at the project root.
- Before touching a file in any directory, read the corresponding flow-specific README in `readme/` (e.g., `readme/FLOWS.md` for logic).
- After any code change, update the corresponding flow-specific README in `readme/`.
- After any flow change, update `readme/FLOWS.md`.
- After adding a new feature or flow, update `readme/FLOWS.md` or create a new flow-specific document in `readme/` and register it in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` itself must be updated whenever a new flow README is added.
- **No per-directory or per-module READMEs**: do not create `README.md` files in inner folders or for individual modules (routes, controllers, etc.). All documentation must focus on flows and patterns in `readme/`.

---

## 2. Package hygiene

- Never add two packages that solve the same problem.
  - Date/time: use **moment** (already in use) only — do not add dayjs, date-fns, luxon.
  - HTTP client: use **axios** only (not got, node-fetch, ky).
  - Validation: use **joi** (already in use) only — do not add zod, yup.
  - ORM: use **mongoose** only — do not introduce a second ODM.
- Do not modify `package.json` without explicit instruction.
- After adding a package, document it in `readme/METHODS.md` under a "Dependencies" section.

---

## 3. Git workflow

### Default branches
Every repository starts with exactly two long-lived branches:
- `main` — production-ready, protected
- `dev` — integration branch; all features merge here first

### Starting a new feature
1. Check out from `dev`: `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
3. If `feature/<name>` already exists locally or remotely, use `feature/<name>-2` (increment until unique).
4. Work on the feature branch only.

### Committing
- Write conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`
- Include a short body describing *why*, not just *what*.

### Pull requests
- Target branch is always `dev` (never `main` directly).
- PR title format: `[TYPE] Short description` — e.g. `[feat] Add attendance summary endpoint`
- PR description must include:
  - **Summary** — what changed and why
  - **Changes** — bullet list of files/modules affected
  - **Testing** — how to verify the change
  - **Related ticket** — link if applicable
- **Never self-merge.** Leave the PR open for human review.
- Do not delete the branch after PR creation.

---

## 4. PR review instructions

When asked to review a PR:
1. Summarise all changes in plain language (what feature/fix was introduced, what files changed).
2. Identify **risky code snippets** — flag each with a risk percentage and a short reason:
   - Risk is based on: deviation from existing patterns, missing error handling, untested edge cases, performance implications, security surface area.
   - Format: `⚠ Risk 70% — reason here`
3. Call out anything that does not match the project's existing implementation style.
4. Note any missing README updates.
5. **Do not approve or request changes on behalf of the reviewer** — summarise only.

---

## 5. GitHub tickets

When asked to create a ticket (GitHub issue):
- Title: concise, action-oriented (`Add pagination to /sites endpoint`)
- Body must include: **Context**, **Acceptance criteria**, **Notes** (optional)
- Apply labels if the project's label set is known (bug, enhancement, chore, etc.)
- When creating a PR for work that has a ticket, link the issue in the PR description using `Closes #<issue-number>` or `Relates to #<issue-number>`.

---

## 6. Code style

- Follow the existing pattern in the file you are editing.
- Do not introduce a new pattern or library without noting it in the relevant README.
- Prefer explicit over clever.
- No commented-out code left in commits.
- JavaScript (CommonJS): use `require`/`module.exports` — no ES module syntax.
- Async handlers: always use `try/catch` or pass errors to `next(err)`.
- Controller functions: extract business logic to service functions when complexity warrants.

---

## 7. Environment and config

- Never hard-code secrets, API keys, or environment-specific values.
- All config goes through `process.env` with `.env` file.
- New environment variables must be documented in `readme/ARCHITECTURE.md` and added to `.env.example` (if it exists).

---

## 8. Testing

- New features require at least a unit test for the service/util layer.
- Bug fixes require a regression test.
- Do not remove existing tests.

---

## 9. Multi-tenancy

- Every new resource model **must** include a `builderId` field referencing the owning builder.
- Every query **must** be filtered through `builderScope` middleware to enforce data isolation.
- Never return cross-tenant data unless the requesting user is `SUPER_ADMIN`.

---

## 10. Initial Project Alignment (Migration)

When these configuration files (`CLAUDE.md`, `RULES.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`) are first copied into an existing project:
- **Immediate Audit:** Read the actual project directory and update the `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to reflect the *real* file tree and naming conventions of that specific project.
- **Version Alignment:** Run `node -v`, `npm -v`, etc., and update the "Framework Versions" section in the structure files to match the environment.
- **Registry Update:** Update the `README registry` in `CLAUDE.md` to point to the correct paths where these files are now located.
- **Agent Adaptation:** Review the instructions in `AGENTS.md` and modify any triggers or paths that differ from this template.
